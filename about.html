            <h3>Online Game</h3>
            <h5>Online gaming describes any video game that offers online interactions with other players. Video games used to be classified by an Online Content PEGI descriptor to signify whether they were online or not. However, as most games now provide
                online interactions this distinction is no longer used. What is still different game to game, is the level of interaction on offer. How much information players share and how many people they interact with are the two key factors for parents
                to be aware of.
            </h5>
            <h3>Offers clear benefits for children</h3>
            <h5>Online games are important to understand because they offer a huge amount of fun, enjoyment, teamwork, collaboration and imaginative adventure for children. Played healthily they contribute an essential part of childrens development and socialisation.
                However, its important for parents to understand online gaming so they can encourage safe and healthy habits in children and technology from a young age.</h5>
